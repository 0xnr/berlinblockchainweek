    "In the frame of Berlin Blockchain Week, Centrifuge and Blue Yard are
    hosting an evening of cross-pollination and discussion around the impact
    of blockchain technology in supply chains. To what extent is blockchain
    innovation a driver for sustainability and inclusive financing in
    international trade? Blockchain not only allows more secure and
    transparent transactions, immutable traceability and reputation, but also
    provides the infrastructure on top of which to build inclusive financial
    instruments. We have invited progressive companies and institutions
    working on the frontiers of their fields: Provenance, Einhorn, GIZ
    (Blockchain Lab) and Token Economy, for an evening of vibrant
    discussion."
