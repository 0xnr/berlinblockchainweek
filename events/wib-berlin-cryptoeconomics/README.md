    Why should we care about crypto economics and token design? Crypto
      economics is a field that is relatively new to the world but rapidly
      evolving. The way we interact with each other and exchange value is
      moving towards decentralization. This means that we are creating a
      system where anything of value can be exchanged peer to peer without a
      central entity that determines and enforces rule sets or laws. Instead
      of placing trust in central custodians we rely on certain rules
      translated into code.
  -
    The way we design these protocols influences how we interact with each
      other in this system and what we deem valuable. Therefore, when
      designing these protocols it is essential to consider how they will be
      used, misused, who the different stakeholders are and what an adequate
      incentivisation mechanism looks like.
  -
    In this session we will explore how these systems evolve and what aspects
      are important to take into account when doing so.
